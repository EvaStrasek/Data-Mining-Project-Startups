# Data-Mining-Project-Startups

Startups play a crucial role in economic growth, innovation, and job creation. However, only a small share of startups manage to achieve significant growth, while many fail in their early stages. Understanding which factors contribute to startup growth is therefore an important topic for researchers, investors, and policymakers.

The objective of this project is to analyze startup data using data mining techniques in order to predict startup growth. Due to the limited availability of financial performance data for early-stage firms, growth is proxied using observable characteristics such as funding information, company status, industry, geographic location, and firm age. By applying supervised machine learning methods, this project aims to identify the key factors associated with startup growth and evaluate the predictive performance of different models.
